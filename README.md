# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment2
This program is a library system for CIS-17B. The main functionalities of the program work, however, there are problems to the back-end of the program. I tried to utilize an array to store multiple data inputs, such as students, faculty, and books. However, because of the large scope of this program's demands, I could only implement the menu and a "pseudo" store, which isn't able to store anything. To use this program, input the numerical keys into the menu. Anything other than numbers throws an infinite loop. Inputs into data shouldn't give any errors, but the way I implemented it could see some varying results. As for implementations, most methods and practices are implemented in the program. The only problem is storage and overall handling. To see a more visualized approach, see the simplified UML diagram showcasing the program's implements.
